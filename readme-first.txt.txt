To make sure that it will work fine, you have to follow below steps:

1. Create database with name "form" in your database. If you create database with any other name then change database name in "connect.php" file.

2. Create table with name "users_detail" in this database with below fields: fname(first name), lname(last name), email and password. Don't forget to include a id field with auto_increment.

3. That's all. Use this form for any purpose freely.
